# Topic-modeling

This repository is for exploring topic modeling with Gensim https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html

Many of the scripts are based on Gensim's tutorials and adapted for my own use.

My goal is to model topics of tweets and build a word list by topic sorted by word frequency. The output should include 4 parameters: word, topic, frequency of the word and document.
